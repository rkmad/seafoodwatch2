Habitat, chemicals, disease and the source of stock are also serious concerns. In the E.U. and Turkey, chemicals and escapes are the biggest concerns. These locations have somewhat effective frameworks for regulating chemical use. However, while there\u2019s uncertainty about how frequently antibiotics that are important to human health are used in some countries, the available data indicate that antibiotic use can be significant. Also, multiple, large-scale escapes of farmed fish have and continue to occur, though some areas have enacted best practice measures to limit these events.

Wastewater that hasn\u2019t been adequately treated before it\u2019s discharged is unlikely to have nutrient-related impacts beyond the immediate area, but it may contribute to cumulative environmental impacts at the waterbody or regional levels.

Wastewater that hasn\u2019t been adequately treated before it\u2019s discharged is unlikely to have nutrient-related impacts beyond the immediate area, but it may contribute to cumulative environmental impacts at the waterbody or regional levels.

Similarly, it\u2019s unlikely the water that\u2019s discharged daily has been disinfected against disease.

Wastewater that hasn\u2019t been adequately treated before it\u2019s discharged is unlikely to have nutrient-related impacts beyond the immediate area, but it may contribute to cumulative environmental impacts at the waterbody or regional levels. Indoor recirculating systems tend to have low chemical use. However, most producers can release up to 10 percent of daily water flow without treatment, and that water may contain chemicals or their byproducts. Similarly, it\u2019s unlikely the water that\u2019s discharged daily has been disinfected against disease. However, there\u2019s a low risk of disease transmission to wild species when fish are farmed in indoor recirculating tanks because it\u2019s not common for disease outbreaks to occur.

Many \u201cGood Alternative\u201d sources of tuna are caught with trolling lines, harpoons, handlines and hand-operated pole-and-lines or purse seines that don\u2019t use floating objects (non-FAD). However, there are some Indian Ocean sources caught with these gears on the \u201cAvoid\u201d list, so please check our recommendations first. Don\u2019t buy any species of farmed bluefin tuna or any tuna caught internationally with drifting longlines or floating object purse seines (FAD). Also, take a pass on bigeye tuna caught by U.S. fleets in the Atlantic with drifting longlines and all wild sources of Pacific bluefin and Southern bluefin tuna. If you\u2019re not sure of the species, where it\u2019s from and how it was caught, err on the side of caution and look for other \u201cBest Choice\u201d seafood."], ["BEST CHOICE", "BEST CHOICE",
